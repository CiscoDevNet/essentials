# Known issues

- **DOES NOT MASK NUMBERS.** Use caution when working with sensitive numbers like salary. Numbers are not masked to allow for calculations.
- Names - Typing names will sometimes mask the first name only, not the last name. **Copy/paste a person's full name** to mask it as one item, e.g., `${person_1}`.
- Addresses - Use caution when working with addresses. Sometimes only parts of a full address will mask - the street address will mask, but not the city or state.
