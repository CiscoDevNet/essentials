# How the documentation is organized

![Organized documents](/documentation/colorful-bookcase-8EzNkvLQosk.jpg)

The documentation is inspired by [Django's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) and organized into the following types:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/cae) take you by the hand through a series of steps. Start here if youâ€™re new.
- [How-to guides](how-to/develop-with-dialogflow) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge.
- [Topic guides](topics/gve-apps/grover) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Reference guides](api) contain technical reference for **APIs**. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
