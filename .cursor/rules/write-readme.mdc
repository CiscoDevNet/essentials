# How to Write a README

When writing or updating a README, follow this framework in order. A reader should be able to answer two questions quickly: **"Does this solve my problem?"** and **"How do I use it?"**

## 1. Example First

Start with a short, runnable code snippet that shows the most common use case. The reader should be able to infer how the project works from this example alone.

- Show what the project does, not how it's built.
- Keep it minimal — one common use case, not the full API.
- A one-line description before the example (e.g., "Like `mkdir -p`, but in node.js!") adds important context.

## 2. Installation

Provide copy-pasteable install commands. Aim for a one- or two-liner. If the procedure is complex, break it into numbered steps — don't leave the reader guessing.

## 3. API / Usage

Document the main entry points. Start with the most obvious one and work outward.

- Name each function/class/command with its signature.
- Describe each parameter: type, whether it's required or optional, and what it does.
- Don't rely solely on the example for this — be explicit.

## 4. Running Tests

If the project has tests, state how to run them in a single command (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`). Mention what framework is used and what the tests cover.

## 5. License

A short mention is fine (e.g., "MIT"). Link to the full LICENSE file if one exists.

## 6. Stay Focused

A README answers **"What is it?"** and **"How do I use it?"** — nothing more. Keep design rationale, architecture deep-dives, and opinions out of the README. Link to separate docs, ADRs, or blog posts for that content.
